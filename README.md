# go-simple

The goal of this project is to make a simple api-handler for golang.
The main purpose for initialize this project is, I do some side projects and each time I write a lot of boiler code.
So, I decided to write something very general that will save a lot of time in future development.

## Project Structure & Improvements

Currently, this project structure provides a solid starting point for me and other users. It follows common Go project conventions, with separate directories for different concerns such as command-line interfaces, database interactions, server setup, and user-related logic. This structure promotes maintainability and testability, especially for larger projects.

One of the strengths of this project is its robust error handling. The application is designed to handle errors effectively, providing clear error messages and preventing the application from exiting unexpectedly. This makes the functions easier to test and reuse.

However, there's always room for improvement. Here are a few potential areas to consider:

### Authentication & Authorization

Currently, the project does not implement any specific authentication or authorization mechanisms. All API endpoints are publicly accessible without requiring user login or role-based permissions.

However, as the project grows and the need for secure access increases, I plan to implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. Potential options include JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.


### Database Migrations

In the future, I plan to add more flexibility to the PostgreSQL migration files. This will allow us to manage database schema changes more effectively, ensuring that our database structure evolves smoothly as the project grows.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Another area for potential improvement is the addition of a CI/CD setup. Currently, the project lacks this, but adding it could help automate testing and deployment, improving the development workflow.

As always, the effectiveness of a project structure largely depends on the specific needs of the project and the team's preferences. We should be open to reevaluating and adjusting the structure as needed.
